Prompt: 
Create a tool that analyzes large sets of legal documents from real estate financing transactions (e.g., contracts, leases, mortgages, etc) in PDF format and extracts certain data from the documents to generate a form based on a template I provide. 

Thought Process: 
The user is asking me to create a tool that:
1. Analyzes large sets of legal documents from real estate financing transactions
2. These documents are in PDF format
3. The tool should extract specific data from these documents
4. The tool should generate a form based on a template provided by the user

This is a document processing and information extraction task. I should create a solution that:
- Can parse and extract text from PDF files
- Uses NLP techniques to identify and extract specific data points
- Generates a form based on a template

Let me first explore the workspace to understand what's already available, then plan how to build this tool.

Response:
I'll create a tool that can analyze real estate legal documents in PDF format, extract relevant data, and generate forms based on your templates. Let's start by exploring the workspace structure.

I see that the project is called "CIS-Generator" but we're just getting started with it. Let's create a comprehensive tool for analyzing legal documents and generating forms from them.
First, let's create a proper project structure with the necessary files. Here's what we'll need:
A Python-based application for PDF processing
Libraries for PDF text extraction, NLP, and form generation
A configuration system for templates
A user interface for interacting with the tool
Let's start by setting up the project structure and requirements:

(proceeds to create files)

Great! We have successfully created a comprehensive tool for analyzing legal documents from real estate financing transactions and generating forms based on templates. Here's a summary of what we've built:
PDF Processing System:
Extracts text from PDF documents using PyPDF2 and pdfplumber
Handles tables, form fields, and metadata extraction
Supports region-based extraction for targeted data
NLP Analysis Engine:
Uses spaCy and NLTK for natural language processing
Classifies document types automatically
Extracts key information like parties, dates, monetary amounts, and property details
Identifies document sections and structures
Form Generation System:
Supports both DOCX and JSON templates
Maps extracted data to template fields
Formats data appropriately (dates, currency, percentages)
Generates output in various formats (DOCX, JSON, Excel)
Web Interface:
User-friendly Flask web application
Upload multiple documents and templates
View extraction results and download generated forms
Responsive design with Bootstrap
Configuration System:
JSON-based configuration
Environment variables for application settings
Default values and fallbacks
Testing and Utilities:
Test scripts for extraction and analysis
Utility functions for configuration and file handling
Example templates and documentation
To use the tool:
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the required NLP models
Run the application using ./run.py
Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000
Upload PDF documents and a template
Process the documents to generate forms

The tool is designed to be extensible, so you can add more extraction patterns, document types, and template formats as needed. The modular architecture makes it easy to maintain and enhance.
